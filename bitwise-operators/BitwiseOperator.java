        /*
        Bitwise operators work on Individual Bits of a the numbers, i.e Bitwise operation is done on each digit of its Binary Representation.

        1. Bitwise AND  - &
            2 & 3 --->
              1 0         
            & 1 1
           =  1 0   = 2     i.e 2 & 3 = 2

           "Bitwise AND with 1  always returns the number itself"

           1 & 3 --->

              0 1
            & 1 1
            = 0 1  = 1


        

        2. Bitwise  XOR - ^

            It gives true if both values are different, i.e...
            1 ^ 0 = 1
            0 ^ 1 = 1
            1 ^ 1 = 0
            0 ^ 0 = 0

            We can also say that A ^ B = A when B = 0
            And, A ^ B = !A when B = 1


            ^ is very helpful in :-
            Finding specific Bit of a no.
            Checking if a no. is even / odd.
